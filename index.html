        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Dawood Khan!</h1>
				<p>I work as a senior Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Sciences--UoK<em>(Currently on a Sabatical)</em> Know more about me. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
			<p>I am a dedicated professional with 15+ years of experience with creating futuristic and innovative digital technologies which allow greater access to industrial automation, including automation systems, software tools and platforms, and control solutions. I have worked on platforms and technologies that drive the new generation of industrial solutions with a special focus AI/ML, NLP, embedded systems and Internet of Things.  I have readily applied the bleeding edge research results in an industrial environment, thereby offering innovative solutions to problems at hand.

I am curious, passionate, with a collaborative mindset. I like to think outside of the box and come up with solutions which are intuitive and clean—at times taking inspiration from the unrelated domain using interdisciplinary collaborations. I  leverage a blend of pure and applied research to work on real-world problems which have a direct measurable business impact. 

I like to be hands-on and have strong software development skills. I like to participate in the product development steps like requirement gathering, design, development, evaluation, deployment. I am a creative problem-solver who is passionate about digging into complex problems and devising new approaches to reach results. I have excellent communication skills and team player attitude.

I have hired, led, developed, and enabled an incredible set of people with diverse backgrounds or experiences. I have worked with cross-functional and interdisciplinary teams to design and develop and deploy systems which include novel machine learning algorithms to advance the “state-of-the-art”, and, in the process, redefine the state of the art for the field. I care about maintaining and improving the status of our workplace to be inclusive and diverse. 

I  have some project management experience as well(Scrum, Kanban). I have worked closely with product teams in a leadership role to identify key priorities which have an impact while continuing to develop a long-term roadmap. Thus ensuring that the solutions have a significant business impact.

Lastly, I enjoy travelling and visiting different places and enjoy different cultural experiences. I am also like taking pictures and reading on very diverse topics from medicine, business, psychology etc.
